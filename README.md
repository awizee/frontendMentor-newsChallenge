## My process

i used only html and css for this project as it is the only tool required for this coding challenge

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-second workflow

### What I learned

things i learned during this project css styling is something we have to look into mre often, and the relationship between parents, child and siblings in the css layout and how to make proper use of gridbox and flex box in styling.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;



### Continued development

i will love to continue practicing more projects and become better at them,
writing more html, css and js codes can improve performance.



### Useful resources

- [ w3school ](https://www.w3school.com) - This helped me for styling and getting used to the syntax and semantics, and how to make a simple hamburger menu. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
